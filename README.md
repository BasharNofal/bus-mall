### BUS MALL

What this code does is, displays 3 random products out of 20 products, then the user votes the products that he likes by clicking on them. The user has 25 votes and each time the user votes 3 new products will show up, so for each round three unique products show up and for the next round another 3 unique products will show up, so no products will appear in two consecutive rounds.

Every vote and each time product is shown will be counted and stored in the local storage, and after the 20 votes are finished a button will appear and by clicking on it the result will show up as a chart, the chart displays how many times and how many votes each product got.

IF the user refreshes the page these the objects for each product that were saved, will be retrieved, these objects contain every product name, relative path, number of votes, and how many time it was shown. If the user wants to clear the data he has to clear them from application list in inspect element tool in his browser.
